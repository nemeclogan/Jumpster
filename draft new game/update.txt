Hi yall! 

So I was able to make a good amount of progress on the game. I just started completely new files 
on my local device and then now I'm adding it to the repo, just because that way was easier for my brain.

First, I had to find new spritesheet characters because the ones that we had were acting 
wonky and I couldnt figure out why. So I found new ones. Good news is also, I found 
new ones in the same package from the same creator, so they look cohesive and fit our animal theme.

So, I added the new cat and updated all the frames so that it can be shown idle and running. 


The next steps I think would be to now do the same for our other character, the dog. 
I already added the spritesheets for the dog animations and they follow the same naming 
conventions as our cat, so hopefully it will be easy to figure out how to add our dog. 

When you play the game, once you collect all the apples, then more fall down and so does a 
bomb. If the cat hits the bomb then the game is over and the cat turns red and stops moving.
I think it would be nice if we can add an actual game over screen. I'm not 100% how to do that
off the top of my head, but I'm sure we can figure it out. If its easy to do then I think we should do it.
If not, no need. 


This is just another suggestion but maybe we should change the apple to be something else. 
Maybe like a treat or something so that it fits more with our theme. I also think if possible we should try to change maybe like the platforms and our background
so that they fit our theme more. I know that is a bit extra but I think it would be cuter!
I am open to working on these 'graphics' aspects if you all are cool with it!!


I am going to be busy most of the day today but once I get home I can also contribute to the 
powerpoint as well!!
